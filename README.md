# Hello-World
Hello humans!

This is Finartzi. I like Google sheets, Typescript, JavaScript and getting them to work with Visual Studio Code environment. 
In addition to that I like to peek inside other IDEs' like VS Community Edition, Netbeans and Eclipse.

At the moment being unemployed I waste most of my time taking care of asema41.fi homepages on Wordpress base when I'm not gathering food from our suppliers, dealing food to our customers and cleaning the facilities we got free to use for our humanitarian service. I decided for this because my actual health doesn't seem to suit going after a full time job that is here in Finland the only way out of misery.

Former I used to program with automation systems Siemens S5, Siemens S7-200, Siemens S7, Dolog AKF, Modicon TSX-Quantum, Selectron MAS 
During my evolving into automation I got a catch of some other programming languages like Turbo Pascal, Delphi, Java, C, C++, C#, Visual Basic 4 - 6, Visual Basic .NET. My interests on Web site development forced me to learn PHP, HTML, CSS and of course databases preferrably MySQL. Before that I only knew MS Access ..

My working experience bases on electrical installations (yes.. this is my original branche), planning, problem solving, engineering, project management, product development and programming in cartonage mills, power plants (coal and nuclear)and commuter trains. 

Spending 22 years of my life in Switzerland, I do speak german as well .. sadly my swedish knowledge didn't evolve ;) . Divorce got me further into Thailand, where I didn't succeed wit a small companionship with a local turist office helping them with translations and homepages, so I got back into roots, of course not so prosperous as I used to be.
